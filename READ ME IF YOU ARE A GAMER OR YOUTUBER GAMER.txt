Run gamemoded -t
if it fails for like the cpu part do in the terminal:
1. sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/set-cpu-governor.service
2.in the nano add [Unit]
Description=Set CPU Governor to Performance
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'echo performance | tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor'
RemainAfterExit=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
3.save the file with control-O
4.sudo systemctl daemon-reload
5.sudo systemctl enable set-cpu-governor.service
6.reboot
and thats it just reboot and run gamemoded -t agan and it should work since it worked for me
For native games like fnf and mods:gamemoderun ./game (replace game name of the game like Funkin note this works for games with "./" thats launch)
For windows game in heroic go to advanced and add "gamemoderun"
for steam games add "gamemoderun %command%"
For clarification GAMEMODE IS NOT MINE RELATE TO https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode FOR THE OFFICIAL REPO
